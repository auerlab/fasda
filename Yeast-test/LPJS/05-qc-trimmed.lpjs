#   Script description:
#       Run quality checks on raw data
#       Based on work of Dr. Andrea Rau:
#       https://github.com/andreamrau/OpticRegen_2019
#
#   Dependencies:
#       Requires directory structure.  Run after *-organize.sh.
#
#       All necessary tools are assumed to be in PATH.  If this is not
#       the case, add whatever code is needed here to gain access.
#       (Adding such code to your .bashrc or other startup script is
#       generally a bad idea since it's too complicated to support
#       every program with one environment.)

# Update PATH on a chimeric cluster (multiple operating systems used for
# compute nodes)
#
# The PATH used by the package manager that installed LPJS (/usr/local for
# FreeBSD ports, usually /usr/pkg or /*/pkg for pkgsrc), is automatically
# prepended to the default PATH.  This is overridden by "#lpjs path", so
# if we use it, we must add all directories ourselves.
#
# Add the default non-priveleged pkgsrc prefix used by auto-pkgsrc-setup.
#
# Caution: Different versions of rsync behave differently with respect
# to creating path components at the destination.  Newer rsync requires
# --mkpath while older ones included with macOS and RHEL do not support
# this flag. Set path to use pkgsrc rsync in ~/Pkgsrc/pkg or /*/pkg.
# /usr/pkg/java is for NetBSD
#lpjs path ~/Pkgsrc/pkg/bin:/opt/pkg/bin:/usr/pkg/bin:/usr/pkg/java/openjdk17/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
#lpjs pull-command rsync --mkpath --copy-links %h:%s/Results/04-trim/\*-sample%i-* Results/04-trim
#lpjs push-command rsync -r Results/05-qc-trimmed %h:%s/Results
